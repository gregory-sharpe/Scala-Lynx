/* 
    given any object and a encryption scheme allow for the object to be encrypted
    encryption scheme would be a function for how to encrypt the object 
    an object A encrypted with E1 and E2 should have the type A encrypted With E1,E2 etc or 
        Type B encrypted with E1,E2 etc where B is linked to A but doesnt have any of the functionallity of A 
    Encryption must be commutative 
        provide a test function that randomly produces E1,E2,...En and test for commutivity
    may require objects to have unique mapping to integers
